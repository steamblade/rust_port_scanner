This is a simple port scanner implemented in Rust using the tokio and tokio-util libraries. This port scanner performs asynchronous scanning of a range of ports on a given host.
First, make sure you have the necessary dependencies in your Cargo.toml file:

```
[dependencies]
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
tokio-util = "0.6"
```
